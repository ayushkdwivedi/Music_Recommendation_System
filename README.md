The two main tasks which this project performs are
1) Recommending relevant songs
2) Predicting rating of a song

The steps performed in order to do this are :- 
1) Preprocess Data
2) Implement song2Vec to make top-n predictions.
3) Using song to vec to create vector representations to be used futhar 
4) Using Matrix Factorization to predict the ratings
5) Comparing our method with other methods.
